# TinyIoC.Bootstrapper


This is TinyIoC.Bootstrapper - a simple, but extendable bootstrapper that picks up an extends the lovely, simple, TinyIoC inversion of control container.

Like TinyIoC, the idea is that the code would be included into your own project, rather than distributed as a compiled dependency.

There's a wordy discussion of the rational for it on my [blog here](http://www.jonegerton.com/dotnet/a-tinyioc-bootstrapper/).

You can get the [Bootstapper code here](https://github.com/jonegerton/TinyIoC.Bootstrapper/blob/master/TinyIoC.Bootstrapper/Bootstrapper.cs), or look at the [example overrides here](https://github.com/jonegerton/TinyIoC.Bootstrapper/blob/master/Examples/ExampleBootstrapper.cs).
